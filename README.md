### Weather Data Service

#### **Project Overview**

This project involves connecting to the **Visual Crossing Weather API** using **Java** to fetch weather data for cities worldwide. The fetched data is stored for future analysis, and various temperature-related calculations are performed on the data. The system also includes **Dockerization** for easy deployment.

---

#### **What Was Done**

##### **1. Integration with Visual Crossing Weather API**
- The project connects to the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to fetch weather data.
- The connection is made using **Java's HTTP capabilities**, retrieving data for cities worldwide.
- The data fetched includes temperature data (min, max) and timestamped hourly weather information.

##### **2. Post-Construction of Weather Data**
- After retrieving the data, the application performs post-processing.
- The fetched data (temperature readings and timestamps) is parsed and stored in the database for further processing.
- Data is fetched for both **historical** and **real-time** weather information.

##### **3. Database Integration (In-Memory Database)**
- The project uses an **in-memory H2 database** for storage during development and testing. Data is temporarily stored during the application's runtime.
- **Database Connection Configuration**:
  - The application connects to the H2 in-memory database.
  - Since it's an in-memory database, the data will not persist after the application stops, making it ideal for development purposes.

##### **4. In Production**
In production, **Azure SQL Database** is used for persistent data storage. Here's how to configure the application to use **Azure SQL**:

1. **SQL Database Setup**
   - Set up an **Azure SQL Database** using the following command:
   ```bash
   az sql server create --name weatherappsqlserverwestus --resource-group weatherResourceGroup --location eastus --admin-user myadmin --admin-password Weather@2025!
   az sql db create --resource-group weatherResourceGroup --server weatherappsqlserverwestus --name weatherDB --service-objective S1
   ```

2. **Update `application-prod.properties`**
   - Update the `application-prod.properties` file with the following connection parameters:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://weatherappsqlserverwestus.database.windows.net:1433;database=weatherDB;encrypt=false;trustServerCertificate=true;loginTimeout=30;
   spring.datasource.username=myadmin
   spring.datasource.password=Weather@2025!
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver

   spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServer2012Dialect
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   ```

---

#### **Features Implemented**

- **Cold Wave Detection**: A feature to detect "cold waves" based on average temperatures over a period of time.
  
- **Temperature Calculations**:
  - **Min/Max Temperatures per City**: Queries that calculate the minimum and maximum recorded temperatures for each city.
  - **Average Temperature Calculation**: A query to compute average temperatures for each city, considering both daily and historical data.

---

#### **Deployment**
The service is **Dockerized** using a **Dockerfile** and deployed to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. A Kubernetes deployment file and service file are created to manage the application within the AKS cluster.

---

### **Database Queries (Spring Data JPA)**

#### 1. **Detecting Cold Waves**
```sql
WITH daily_avg_temp AS (
    SELECT w.city, w.timestamp::date AS day_date,
           AVG((wh.temp - 32) * 5 / 9) AS avg_temp
    FROM weather_day w
    JOIN weather_hour wh ON w.id = wh.weather_day_id
    GROUP BY w.city, w.timestamp::date
), 
coldwave_groups AS (
    SELECT city, day_date, avg_temp,
           SUM(CASE WHEN avg_temp < 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
           OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY day_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS coldwave_group,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY day_date) -
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city, CASE WHEN avg_temp < 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ORDER BY day_date) AS group_id
    FROM daily_avg_temp
) 
SELECT city, group_id, MIN(day_date) AS start_date, MAX(day_date) AS end_date,
       COUNT(*) AS coldwave_length 
FROM coldwave_groups 
WHERE avg_temp < 10 
GROUP BY city, group_id 
ORDER BY city, start_date;
```
**Explanation**: This query calculates average daily temperatures per city, identifies continuous periods where temperatures remain below 10Â°C, and classifies them as cold waves.

#### 2. **Finding Minimum Temperature Per City**
```sql
SELECT city, MIN(min_temp) AS min_temperature
FROM weather_day
GROUP BY city;
```
**Explanation**: This query retrieves the lowest recorded temperature for each city.

#### 3. **Finding Maximum Temperature Per City**
```sql
SELECT city, MAX(max_temp) AS max_temperature
FROM weather_day
GROUP BY city;
```
**Explanation**: This query retrieves the highest recorded temperature for each city.

#### 4. **Finding Average Temperature in a Date Range**
```sql
SELECT city, AVG(min_temp) AS avg_min_temp, AVG(max_temp) AS avg_max_temp
FROM weather_day
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city;
```
**Explanation**: This query calculates the average min and max temperatures per city within a given date range.

### **Dockerization (Dockerfile)**

Create a `Dockerfile` to package the Spring Boot application:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/weather-service.jar weather-service.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "weather-service.jar"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

**Build and Push Docker Image**:
```bash
docker build -t weather-service:latest .
docker tag weather-service:latest myweatherregistry.azurecr.io/weather-service:latest
docker push myweatherregistry.azurecr.io/weather-service:latest
```

---

### **Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

1. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Create Azure Resources**:
   ```bash
   az group create --name weatherResourceGroup --location eastus
   az acr create --resource-group weatherResourceGroup --name myweatherregistry --sku Basic
   az aks create --resource-group weatherResourceGroup --name weatherAKSCluster --node-count 1 --enable-managed-identity --generate-ssh-keys
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group weatherResourceGroup --name weatherAKSCluster
   ```

3. **Create Deployment YAML (deployment.yaml)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: weather-service
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: weather-service
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: weather-service
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: weather-service
           image: myweatherregistry.azurecr.io/weather-service:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```

4. **Create Service YAML (service.yaml)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: weather-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: weather-service
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 85
         targetPort: 8085
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

5. **Deploy the Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   kubectl get service weather-service
   ```

**Getting External IP**:
```bash
kubectl get service weather-service
```
Once you have the **EXTERNAL-IP**, use the following URL to fetch the cold wave data for the past weeks:

```text
http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:85/weather/get/cold-waves
```

Example Response:
```json
[
    {
        "city": "Jerusalem",
        "groupId": 2,
        "startDate": "2025-02-20",
        "endDate": "2025-02-27",
        "coldwaveLength": 8
    },
    {
        "city": "TelAviv",
        "groupId": 5,
        "startDate": "2025-02-23",
        "endDate": "2025-02-25",
        "coldwaveLength": 3
    }
]
```
